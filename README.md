Composite Out and Power Supply Modification Instructions for the Atari 5200 4-Port Game Console

## Power Modification

The original 4-Port Atari 5200, released in 1982, draws its power from an adapter connected at the far end of its long and bulky coaxial RF cable.  For use on a modern television using composite out, this is an inconvenience.  This site contains instructions on how to replace this cumbersome arrangement with a simple barrel jack on the back of the console.
